            I was born in Beijing, China, and immigrated here with my parents and twin sister in 1994. In 1995, my parents welcomed a new baby sister, who recently completed studies at U.C. Davis. Growing up in America was a new, emotional change for me as I experienced a lot of culture shock on top of family dysfunction, but eventually San Diego, California became my new home. I became Naturalized with my family, all except my mom, in 2003. I don't get to visit my family back in China much, but my sister keeps in touch with everyone for us both.</p>

            As a young adult, I was the shy, awkward nerd girl, and spent my days watching anime, reading manga, and drawing. Though I don't do any of those things now, I have developed quite a talent for painting as a hobby, and plan to launch a YouTube channel soon. When I was younger, didn't have much of a fashion sense, and did not have the luxury of making my own clothing choices so I was the definition of the phrase: "Your mother dresses you funny." I didn't get a clear grasp of what looks good on me until well into my late 20s. Thankfully with time, and social media make-up tutorials, I was able to be more fashionable, confident, and less awkward. I even drive strangers in my car through rideshare (Uber/Lyft) but sometimes there are awkward moments that really can't be helped.
